            <p>I added saving position and checking which player wins and if is draw. Unfortunetly game stops after
                showing a score. That was fun! If you want to play link is still active:<a
                    href="https://wokwi.com/projects/400423663340737537"> Link to the wokwi simulator where I working
                    around. </a> I told my wife about my project. She was suprised how little time i need to wrote this
                without many experience. Me too. I am proud of myself. Strange feeling. <br> Next steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><s>TODO: Saving position of the dot to the array which diode should be turned on</s></li>
                <li>TODO: Add reset functionality to start game again</li>
                <li>TODO: Add another LEDs with diffrent colour to diference between players</li>
                <li>TODO: Add sound effects to the game! Game needs to have superb sound!</li>
                <li>TODO...</li>

                registers. Link to the wokwi simulator where I working around. <a>here sould be link :) </a> <br>
                Status:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buttons work and i can move around dot by pressing the keys. I have only one colour diode</li>
