            <p>After break back to the business :). I rewrite code which i wrote on the paper. Surprise! Dont work
                correctly. My assumption about multiplexing and dont using HiZ state was wrong. First I thinking that I
                made miswiring, but I wrote another program that check connection. They was or
                all right. Started bitbanging how it really works and surprise. HiZ is necessary. I have all states
                which my code should have and tomorrow I will start with the function recreation to display state of game.  </p>

            <p>I added saving position and checking which player wins and if is draw. Unfortunately game stops after
                showing a score. That was fun! If you want to play link is still active:<a
                    href="https://wokwi.com/projects/400423663340737537"> Link to the wokwi simulator where I working
                    around. </a> I told my wife about my project. She was surprised how little time i need to wrote this
                without many experience. Me too. I am proud of myself. Strange feeling. <br> Next steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><s>TODO: Saving position of the dot to the array which diode should be turned on</s></li>
                <li>TODO: Add reset functionality to start game again</li>
                <li>TODO: Add another LEDs with different color to deference between players</li>
                <li>TODO: Add sound effects to the game! Game needs to have superb sound!</li>
                <li>TODO...</li>

            <p>I am soo grateful that my first stage of code works and I have solid foundation. Currently I am starting
                to develop my uC and C programming skills. I start on the tic tac toe game on AVRmega 328p on the
                registers. Link to the wokwi simulator where I working around. <a>here should be link :) </a> <br>
                Status:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buttons work and i can move around dot by pressing the keys. I have only one color diode</li>
                <li>TODO: Saving position of the dot to the array which diode should be turned on</li>
                <li>TODO...</li>
