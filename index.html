            <p>Breadbording. I want to start with led connection. I copied code from wokwi to the unor3 and lets go! There was a some sort of random coupling signal and turning random other leds. I rewired it one more time. Second thought was to change ports from PD0-PD5 to PD2-PD7 to avoid connection to the atmega16u2 used for UART. I started connecting it row by row. I helps a lot. But... If is only one row works like charm. When I connect second row current flow thru the pullup resistors. Probably resistance of 330R is to small and I need to increase it. Tomorrow I will try. Weekend was intense so I need to sleep earlier. <br><br> PS When I had problem with random blinking my wife went behind me and said "Oh I want to our Christmas tree light was blinking like that" Heh :) </p>

        <section>
            <p>Maybe milestones should be created first, but I am designing process of designing, learning with it and pushing myself to learn new skills. Below list with milestones and </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>DONE! </b>Milestone A finished! uC code is fully working. Probably some improvements will be implemented but in this stage all functionality is working. Start to prepare schematic, buy some elements and build first prototype. </li>
                <li>Milestone B is building working electronic prototype without special power delivery circuits.</li>
                <li>Milestone C is developing battery power system with supervising (and charging maybe).</li>
                <li>Milestone D is fully working device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A and D probably will be the hardest milestones but first is past. Now is time to hardware, point I feel more confident, but it is my first device with embedded micro. Goal is more visible but still road should be the most important. Learning, developing skills and not leaving project in the begining.</p>
            <p>I need to make plan, what should I learn when I will be waiting for components. In my head are some ideas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>uC - Timers and controlling PWM</li>
                <li>Capacitive touch - testing old prototypes</li>
                <li>IuC - 2C or SPI implementation</li>

            </ol>
            <p>I am proud of myself. I am thinking about some review of my code. Probably it is the best option to gain experience from tutor.</p>
            <p>St. Peter and st. Paul day.</p>
            <p>Maybe each project should have different page? There are only one proj, but if I start new there will be mix. That is wrong? I dont't know.</p>

            <p>First try of using timers. BEEE. Don't work at all. I additionally add resistors to the wokwi simulation and draw schematic in the KiCAD. I want to have connection in the other place to eventually can share my problem in stackoverflow. <Br> <br> OMG I FOUND SOLUTION!!! <br> I should before change DDR register turn off PORT register to be shure that nothing happend. But that was some state before and it make some little glow of leds. Small but serious mistake. PS. timer0 working. :)</p>

            <p>TODO update. So i create functions but it is not working properly. I need to deep dive into the timers probably. :) I cant use position with playerA and B scores and... Maybe I need to use next variable that is moving not is a decimal value?</p>

            <p>After break back to the business :). I rewrite code which i wrote on the paper. Surprise! Dont work
                correctly. My assumption about multiplexing and dont using HiZ state was wrong. First I thinking that I
                made miswiring, but I wrote another program that check connection. They was or
                all right. Started bitbanging how it really works and surprise. HiZ is necessary. I have all states
                which my code should have and tomorrow I will start with the function recreation to display state of game.  </p>

            <p>I added saving position and checking which player wins and if is draw. Unfortunately game stops after
