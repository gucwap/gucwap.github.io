            <p> Parts delivered, soldering tip too. I updated schematic and put all the trickiest tracks to swap pins of
                m168p. I setup my bench for the next week and for the end of the day mess is here xd. I started
                soldering with Pb free solder to be sure my small daughter or her cousins are safe. I hope will finish
                tomorrow and commissioning with soft will be the last thing. Additionally I want to put extra cover from
                the back to be sure that connection and battery are safe. </p>

                <p> I need to create this for this stage about 40 hours and in that stage it shows how time I need to learn new things and integrate with my old ones.  </p>
                <p>PS. I got the idea to add some new functionality to this board. Only software. I can't wait to try implement in the code.</p>

            <p> I measure current 7 mA without power supply diode. I can use LM7805 or don't use it if use rechargeable
                battery. Probably i put only 4x AA battery holder on the back of this game. If my box will arrive with
                parts I solder it to perfboard and make Milestone D. Next project can be interesting because I have 2
                old boards with me - 1st old sumo board I mentioned last time and 2nd unfinished component tester from
                my father. Probably I want to finish the second one before we will see. 3rd topic is to fix my 14 years
                old usbasp programmer. I don't remember what is the reason that it don't work but it is more nostalgic
                and I try to check it the meantime :)</p>
            <p>I am exited because I got my first JBC original soldering tip and I start using it. I hope my temporary
                setup desk will be ok for the fist soldering action.</p>

            <p>Yesterday I try to put it together but some problem with programmer stopped me. Fortunately I have uno so
                I have spare programmer. That was some problem today with strange behavior or all setup and I don't know
                why. Miswiring is explanation :). I connected all buttons and make tweaks in code for led and start
                working properly without any problem. I started development of sounds for button clicking, error
                handling and after finishing the game. That is fun!</p>
            <p>Extra I try to turn on old PCB made by me and my Father. I found articles from 2010 about building sumo
                robot with atmega16. Wow I was 13 and I don't have any knowledge about electronics at all. I knew
                english very little. I powered board and its working, LED is blinking like first article told. I
                remember that was painful experience, because many thing didnt work and I was mailing with author of the
                articles. Memories :'). I will try to put some other code to it and maybe finish this sumo project. But
                first TTT!</p>

            <p>I connected it to the uno, put fixes from day 9 and found some small bug fixed to. So I decided to take
                m168p from my box, usbasp and try to program it like it should be done ;). Blink works from the first
                try but I found some problems with programming, I don't know why I have so much problems with
                connections. </p>
            <p>Simulation was grate, but I found one problem (i don't find any solution) warnings are ignored by
                simulation and didn;t show me so I didn't info that I something is not the best working in the
                background.</p>

            <p>Breadbording. I want to start with led connection. I copied code from wokwi to the uno r3 and lets go!
                There was a some sort of random coupling signal and turning random other leds. I rewired it one more
                time. Second thought was to change ports from PD0-PD5 to PD2-PD7 to avoid connection to the atmega16u2
                used for UART. I started connecting it row by row. I helps a lot. But... If is only one row works like
                charm. When I connect second row current flow thru the pull up resistors. Probably resistance of 330R is
                to small and I need to increase it. Tomorrow I will try. Weekend was intense so I need to sleep earlier.
                <br><br> PS When I had problem with random blinking my wife went behind me and said "Oh I want to our
                Christmas tree light was blinking like that" Heh :)
            </p>
            <p>UPDATE!!! IS WORKING. GOOD NIGHT! Only tweaks in code and woho! I mess and turing gpios as output and
                turining on it and if i change it to the input and HiZ is the best option :) I don't know why i want to
                use pullups :) </p>

        <section>
            <p>Maybe milestones should be created first, but I am designing process of designing, learning with it and
                pushing myself to learn new skills. Below list with milestones and </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>DONE! </b>Milestone A finished! uC code is fully working. Probably some improvements will be

                <li>Milestone D is fully working device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A and D probably will be the hardest milestones but first is past. Now is time to hardware, point I feel
                more confident, but it is my first device with embedded micro. Goal is more visible but still road
                should be the most important. Learning, developing skills and not leaving project in the begining.</p>
            <p>I need to make plan, what should I learn when I will be waiting for components. In my head are some
                ideas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>uC - Timers and controlling PWM</li>
                <li>Capacitive touch - testing old prototypes</li>
                <li>IuC - 2C or SPI implementation</li>

            </ol>
            <p>I am proud of myself. I am thinking about some review of my code. Probably it is the best option to gain
                experience from tutor.</p>
            <p>St. Peter and st. Paul day.</p>
            <p>Maybe each project should have different page? There are only one proj, but if I start new there will be
                mix. That is wrong? I dont't know.</p>

                correctly. My assumption about multiplexing and don't using HiZ state was wrong. First I thinking that I
                made miswiring, but I wrote another program that check connection. They was or
                all right. Started bitbanging how it really works and surprise. HiZ is necessary. I have all states
                which my code should have and tomorrow I will start with the function recreation to display state of
